# Malaria_TB_Analysis
An analysis of malaria and TB cases reported in some parts of Africa over the past 10 years. This will help us understand the trend of the two infectious diseases that affect majority of the population in the developing world.

## Objectives of the data analysis
1. To investigate if malaria and TB cases declined over time
2. To analyse the trend of mortality and detection rates for TB
3. To understand the success rate of treating TB over time

## Sources of data
Malaria cases reported were collected from World Health Organization, Global Health Observatory Data Repository/World Health Statistics (http://apps.who.int/ghodata/). WHO compiles data on reported cases of malaria, submitted by the national malaria control programmes (NMCPs).

Tuberculosis cases/data were collected from World Health Organization, Global Tuberculosis Report.
